Your response goes here!
  * The new skills I have learned so far include the figure tag, superscript tag, and writing in markdown.
  * It has been easy so far to adapt the skills taught in the video lessons to the quizzes and projects.
  * It has been difficult to keep driving through challenges without stopping. I may need to take more breaks in between.
  * I have used the problem solving strategies from the first project in every aspect of my life, not just the challenges!
